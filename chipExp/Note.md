### nwd4: non-accurate current mirror

The gate voltage seems to follow the Id. **However:**
    1. The small error is still exists. The evaporation problem should have been excluded. The electrode may be the problem.
    2. **GateV follow Id doesn't mean Id follow Bias Current.**

##### One thing is weird:

This use the non-accurate current mirror. The match btw Im and weighted Id(times with 4) should be imperfect because of the short channel effect. **But it appeared to be a beutiful constant (â‰ˆ 700n).** Instead, the imperfect match happens on nwd1 which use accurate mirror bias (refer to the nwd1 part).

##### Should do anothor exp on nwd4: GVT with Vimp, Id Im is measured


### nwd1: accurate current mirror
